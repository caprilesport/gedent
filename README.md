# gedent

`gedent` is an input generator for computational chemistry workflows. 
It strives to be simple and as general as possible, while contained in the
boundaries of the quantum chemistry research. 

`gedent` stands for *gerador de entradas*, which is the portugues translation for 
input generator. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

`gedent` aims to provide a paradigm of configurations and templates for software 
such as [XTB](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), 
[orca](https://www.faccts.de/orca/), 
[ADF](https://www.scm.com/), 
[Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/), 
[NWChem](https://www.nwchem-sw.org/) 
and similar chemistry software suites. 
 Although it aims to support such software and was thought with this
use case in mind, it is a template CLI combined with a user defined configuration,
so if you find another use for it, feel free to open a pull request with 
features that support your needs.

## Is it any good?

## Installation

### Requirements

Before installing `gedent`
you need to make sure you have
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (version 1.65.0 or later)
and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/),
the package manager for Rust,
installed.

If you dont already have rust and cargo installed, you can
[install them with rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### From [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/gedent) 

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed,
you can install `gedent` from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install gedent
```

This will download the necessary dependencies,
compile the `gedent` binary,
and install it in your system.

### Directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/caprilesport/gedent)

Alternatively,
you can install `gedent` directly from the GitHub repository
using Cargo by running:

```bash
cargo install --git=https://github.com/caprilesport/gedent.git
```

### By cloning the GitHub repository

You can also build `gedent` from source by cloning the GitHub repository
and running `cargo build`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caprilesport/gedent.git
cd gedent
cargo build --release
```

After building,
the binary will be located at `target/release/gedent`.


## Configuration

`gedent` offers support for a per-project configuration file, it searches previous 
directories and if no config file - a 
a gedent.toml file - is found, it uses the 
default config location (`~/.config/gedent` in linux).

Pairing the user defined config file with the power of [TERA templates](https://keats.github.io/tera/)
gives rise to a rich system of input generation.

The config file accepts any keys, and is composed of a `[gedent]` block, which as of now
only supports a default extension, and a user defined `[parameters]` section, which can be 
accessed by templates. A default config 
file is provided by gedent with some example defaults for the templates that are 
shipped with the program.

Here is an example configuration for `gedent`:

```toml
[gedent]
default_extension = "gjf"

[parameters]
charge = 1
mult = 1
solvation = true
solvent = "dmso"
random_field = "any valid toml data"
other_named_key = [100, 38, 29]
```

## Templates basics

In general, to interact with the templates `gedent` has a `template` subcommand.
With it you can create, edit, list and print templates.

### Getting started

To understand the full functionalities of the templates, please visit
[the tera templates documentation](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#getting-started)
, which offers a comprehensive guide on the capabilities of the tera template language. 
It is heavily based on the [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)
and [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/templates/language/) 
template languages, so if you know
any of these you will feel right at home.

### Creating new templates

To create new templates, you can add a base template in the `presets` directory, then call gedent:
```bash
gedent template new "new_template_name"
```

If you call it without the preset name, a fuzzy dialogue box will open for 
you to select what preset to use for your new template. It is then opened 
in your default to editor for you to modify it.

Right now, we ship the following basic template presets with `gedent`:
- [orca](https://www.faccts.de/orca/)
- [ADF](https://www.scm.com/) 
- [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) 
- [NWChem](https://www.nwchem-sw.org/) 

Although these are shipped by default, you are encouraged to create your own base presets. 

The only gedent-specific features in the templates is the metadata header.
On any template file if you use the special delimiter `--@` enclosing the template metada,
which can be placed anywhere in the input. 
Right now, the only supported metadata is the `extension`
directive, where it sets the default extension for the file, but there are plans to support templates
with more than 1 xyz file per template, for exemple.

An example of the template metada looks like this:

```toml
--@
extension = "inp"
--@
```

It is provided in [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) style syntax.

### Rendering templates

The only accepted format in this release is the `.xyz` format. If you have a system
written in another format, [openbabel](https://openbabel.org/) is a great tool to convert it
to the `.xyz` format.

Once you have a coordinates file and a template, generating a new input is as easy as:

```bash
gedent gen `name_of_template` example.xyz
```

Wildcards are also available, so `gedent gen orca/opt *.xyz` works as well.
If you're unsure about the template name `gedent template list` lists all your 
available templates.

### The molecule object

`gedent` parses a xyz file to a `Molecule` object, which has the following fields:
- `filename`: The xyz filename without extension.
- `description`: The second line in the header of the xyz coordinates.
- `atoms`: A `String` array of each line of the coordinates.

#### Functions defined on the `Molecule` object

On top of the already built-in tera 
[functions](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#built-in-functions) and [filters](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#built-in-filters)
there are two more available functions as of now:
`print_molecule(molecule: Molecule)` and `split_molecule(molecule: Molecule, index: integer)`, which
were made in order to ease a little bit the procces of writing some inputs.

### Workflow example

#### Orca optimization

Suppose we want to use [orca](https://www.faccts.de/orca/) to optimize a water molecule, and it's the first time 
we're using gedent.

We could first create a new template based on the `orca` preset:

```bash
gedent template new opt orca
```

This will create the `opt` template, based on the `orca` preset, and open it 
in your default editor. We can now edit the template to have something like the following:

```bash
--@
extension = "inp"
--@
! {{ functional }} {{ basis_set }}
! Opt freq

%pal
 nprocs {{ nprocs }}
end

%maxcore {{ memory }}

*xyz {{ charge }} {{ mult }}
{{ print_molecule(molecule = Molecule) }}
*
```

Now we need just to make sure we have all the correct parameters in our config to generate
this input. We can look at that with the `config` subcommand:

```bash
gedent config print
```

Which will print something like this:

```toml
charge = 1
basis_set = "def2svp"
functional = "BP86"
dft_type = "GGA"
memory = 3000
mult = 1
nprocs = 8
solvation = false
solvent = "water"
start_hessian = false
```

So it seems like it's all set, except for the charge which should be 0, we can change that with:

```bash
gedent config set
```
Which will let us pick the parameter and change it's value. Now that we're all set we can finally 
generate our optimization input:
(Sidenote: We could also have used the `-c` flag in the `gen` command)


```bash
gedent gen opt h2o.xyz
```

And we will obtain:

```bash
! BP86 def2svp
! Opt freq D3BJ

%pal
 nprocs 8
end

%maxcore 3000

*xyz 0 1
O       -0.981036882      0.000000000     -2.282900972
H       -0.981036882      0.759337000     -1.686857972
H       -0.981036882     -0.759337000     -1.686857972
*
```
